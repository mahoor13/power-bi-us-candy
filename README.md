# US Candy Distributor - Power BI Analytics

## Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive business intelligence solution for a national US candy distributor, leveraging **Power BI** to analyze and visualize key performance data. The dataset contains over 10,000 records across multiple CSV tables, covering sales, product details, customer and factory locations, shipping logistics, and more.

The primary objective is to unlock data-driven insights that improve operational efficiency, product profitability, and supply chain decision-making.

## Why Power BI?

**Power BI** was selected for this project due to its:

- **User-friendly interface** for building interactive dashboards and visuals
- **Powerful DAX language** for creating insightful metrics
- **Integration capabilities** with structured CSV datasets
- **Scalability and sharing** via Power BI Service for stakeholder collaboration
- **Geospatial analytics support** for mapping shipping routes and optimizing distribution centers

By utilizing Power BI, we are able to transform raw shipment and sales data into actionable insights with speed and precision.

## üîé Key Business Insights Delivered

* **üöõ Factory-to-Customer Route Optimization**
  Identified shipping routes from factories to customers based on distance, shipping method, and delivery speed to uncover high-cost or inefficient logistics.

* **üìà Division-Level Sales & Profit Performance**
  Measured total sales, gross profit, and unit economics per product division (Chocolate, Sugar, Other) and compared them against 2024 strategic targets.

* **üìç Geo-Market Penetration & Demand Clustering**
  Mapped order distribution across U.S. ZIP codes, cities, and regions to highlight high-performing markets and underserved demand pockets.

* **üè≠ Factory Allocation Efficiency**
  Cross-analyzed product profitability and assigned factories to evaluate whether relocating production could reduce manufacturing and shipping costs.

* **üí∞ Product Line Margin Intelligence**
  Ranked product lines by gross profit margin and unit cost efficiency to support data-driven marketing, pricing, and discontinuation decisions.

* **üì¶ Order Fulfillment & Shipping Trends**
  Analyzed shipping modes, order volume, and ship dates to improve fulfillment speed, optimize stock planning, and predict future demand.

## üì¶ Deliverables

* **Power BI Dashboard (.pbix)**
  A dynamic, user-friendly dashboard offering interactive views on sales, profitability, geography, and operational performance.

* **Cleaned and Transformed Data Model using Power Query**
  Applied data cleaning, normalization, and schema harmonization techniques in Power Query. Standardized column types, merged lookup tables (e.g., factories, ZIP codes), handled missing or imprecise geospatial data, and ensured relationship integrity across datasets for optimized DAX performance and accurate aggregations.

* **Data Model & Power Query Transformations**
  Robust data transformations and normalization using Power Query to establish relational connections across the *Sales*, *Products*, *Factories*, *US Zips*, and *Targets* tables.

* **Custom DAX KPIs**
  Key measures developed using DAX, including Gross Profit %, Sales-to-Target Ratio, Cost Efficiency Index, and Route Effectiveness Score.

* **Geospatial Analytics**
  Integrated geographic visualizations to correlate ZIP-code-level density and demand with factory proximity.

* **Storytelling**
  Designed narrative-driven report pages that guide stakeholders through key insights‚Äîstarting from high-level metrics down to root causes‚Äîsupporting strategic decisions through data-backed visual storytelling, dynamic filters, and contextual tooltips.
